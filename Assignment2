Assignment 2 

We simply include new codes in continuous running app by using "Rolling Update"
Rolling updates move the pods slowly by overlapping old with new

Update in the yaml file --

 minReadySeconds: 10
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
    
    
cmd: -  kubectl set image deployment <name> nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2
